# Flutter Coding Challenge #2

Welcome to this Flutter coding challenge! This challenge will test your ability to use a custom
Painter.

## Environment

* Platform: **Web** (testing widgets only works with web rendering currently)
* Restrictions
    * Do not modify the `lib/main.dart` file
    * Leave the `lib/src/` folder untouched

## Coding Challenge Task

Your UI designer wants you to draw a custom and would like you to develop this button with flutter.
The
background should also have a gradient. Actually, everything has a gradient, even the border and the
icons.
